The permeability calculation in this script follows these principles:
Darcy's Law Application: The fundamental equation used is derived from Darcy's Law, which relates flow rate through a porous medium to the applied pressure gradient:
k = (μ × L × v) / ΔP
Where:
k is permeability
μ is dynamic viscosity
L is length (dx in the script)
v is Darcy velocity
ΔP is pressure drop
Volume Flux Calculation: The script calculates flux at each cell by:
Computing cell volumes
Multiplying each cell's velocity by its volume (q = V × u)
This accounts for the contribution of each cell to the total flow
Darcy Velocity Determination:
Sum of all volume fluxes (∑q) divided by total domain volume (V)
This gives the effective Darcy velocity which represents the average flow through the porous medium
Permeability Computation:
Using the formula: kxx = μ × dx × U_Darcy_x / ΔP
Where U_Darcy_x is the x-component of Darcy velocity
